# DALI Data Challenge
### Jeremy Hadfield, 22W

## Repository Overview
- **code** Contains all of the jupyter notebooks for this projct. 
- **output** Contains html output files. I recommend reading these rather than the original ipynb files, since the html files contain the output and don't require running all cells. 
- **data** Contains .csv files with the data. 

## Part 1 
I analyzed the WIID dataset using Pandas and described the data with a series of MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Plotly visualizations. I interpreted these visualizations to answer four key questions about the dataset.

## Part 2
I analyzed a dataset on mental health in the tech industry, and used machine learning models (Random Forest Classifiers) to predict mental health outcomes based on demographic factors and workplace conditions.
